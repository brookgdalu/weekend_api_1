<p>The API was able to return 20 objects. This is a Real-Time Federal Campaign Finance API from Sunlight Foundation. It returns upto 100 pages of federal campaign finance information for candidates in the MN Senate specifically for Senate seats that are up in 2014, 2016 and 2018. However, I was not able to display the results in the DOM.</p>
